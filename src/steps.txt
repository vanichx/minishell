Initialize: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. These change aspects of the shellâ€™s behavior.

Interpret: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file) and executes them.

Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.



int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  // Load config files, if any.

  // Run command loop.
  loop();

  // Perform any shutdown/cleanup.

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

loop()
{
	Read: Read the command from standard input.

		we can use get next line to reat the lines

	Parse: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.

	Execute: Run the parsed command.
}
